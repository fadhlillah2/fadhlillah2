📚 I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and am continually learning and experimenting with new technologies. My principle is that a day without learning something new is a day wasted.

🚀 In my career, I've worked on an array of projects, from building microservices architecture, designing REST APIs, and deploying applications on cloud platforms to creating stunning and responsive UI with JavaScript and its frameworks. I always strive to write optimal code and believe that every task is an opportunity to do something exceptional.

💡 My main goal is to contribute to open-source projects that aim to make a significant impact on society and help newcomers on their journey in the tech world.
